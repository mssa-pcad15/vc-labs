## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Entra tenant and the permissions or role required for managing app registrations in the tenant.
- Visual Studio 2022, [configured with WinUI 3 workload and components](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/set-up-your-development-environment?tabs=vs-2022-17-1-a%2Cvs-2022-17-1-b#required-workloads-and-components)

## Setup

### 1. Register the app

First, complete the steps in [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) to register the application.

Use these settings in your app registration.

| App registration <br/> setting  | Value for this sample app                                           | Notes                                                                           |
|--------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**                        | `active-directory-dotnet-winui3`                                    | Suggested value for this sample. <br/> You can change the app name at any time. |
| **Supported account types**     | **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)**  | Suggested value for this sample.                                                |
| **Platform type**               | **Mobile and desktop applications**                                 | Required value for this sample                                                  |
| **Redirect URIs**               | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient`      | Required value for this sample                                                  |

> :information_source: **Bold text** in the tables above matches (or is similar to) a UI element in the Microsoft Entra admin center, while `code formatting` indicates a value you enter into a text box in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

### 2. Open the project in Visual Studio

Next, open the _WinUIApp.csproj_ project in Visual Studio.

### 3. Update code sample in _MainWindow.xaml.cs_ with app registration values

Finally, set the following values in _MainWindow.xaml.cs_.


```csharp
// 'Tenant ID' of your Microsoft Entra instance - this value is a GUID
TenantId = "",

// 'Application (client) ID' of app registration in Microsoft Entra admin center - this value is a GUID
ClientId = ""
```

## Run the application

Run the application by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> in Visual Studio.

The application will open allowing you to click the **Sign In (if needed) & Call Graph** button to use the authentication flow.

## About the code

This .NET 8 WinUI 3 Packaged Desktop App presents a button that initiates an authentication flow using the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL). The user completes this flow in their default web browser. Upon successful authentication, an HTTP GET request to the Microsoft Graph /me endpoint is issued with the user's access token in the HTTP header. The response from the GET request is then displayed to the user. The MSAL client first looks to its token cache, refreshing if necessary, before acquiring a new access token.
