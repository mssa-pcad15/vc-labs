# ASP.NET Core 8.0 Web App - Sign-in user | Microsoft identity platform

This web app, built with ASP.NET Core 8.0 Razor, has added sign-in features. It uses the [OpenID Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols-oidc) and [ASP.NET Core Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-8.0) for authentication. This allows users to sign in with their Microsoft Entra accounts. Once signed in, the app can access protected resources on the userâ€™s behalf.

## Quickstart and tutorial guides for this sample

- For a quickstart experience that gets you started fast, see [Quickstart: Sign in users and call the Microsoft Graph API from an ASP.NET Core web app](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-web-app-dotnet-core-sign-in).

- For a in-depth tutorial that walks you through this sample from start to finish, see [Tutorial: Sign in users and call the Microsoft Graph API from an ASP.NET Core web app](https://docs.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/tutorial-web-app-dotnet-register-app).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

## Setup

### 1. Register the web API application in your Microsoft Entra ID

First, complete the steps in [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/tutorial-web-app-dotnet-register-app) to register a web application in the Microsoft identity platform.

Use the following settings for your app registration:

| App registration <br/> setting | Value for this sample app                          | Notes                                                                                                       |

## About the code

The ASP.NET Core 8.0 Web App will allow users to sign-in, so it can retrieve a Security Token scoped specifically for the Microsoft Graph API, and will use that token to access the user's information. For more information about the proposed scenario, please take a look at the following diagram:
